Interactive Neural Net Grapher

A python program for visualizing neural nets.

Use:
Enter neural net file name. Currently supports GeneticNets type. Tensorflow + PyTorch support will be added soon.
Click 2 inputs from the input list on the control panel.
Click at least 1 output from the output list on the output panel.
The graph will appear in the window. (The red plane)

Settings:
Add data:
Shows data points in blue.
Data percents:
Clumps data points and shows their values as a percent (-1 = 0%, 0 = 50%, 1 = 100%)
Clump:
Clumps data based on similar values + locations
Colorization:
Sets colorization for data points. Blue is default. When colorization mode is based on score, blue represents correct and black represents incorrect. Assumes simple-posi scoring.
Can also colorize based on nn score, this identifies poor classification variables.
